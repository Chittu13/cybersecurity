#### Difference between Defensive security & offensive security

- Breaking into systems might be achieved through exploiting bugs, abusing insecure setups, and taking advantage of unenforced access control policies, among other things. Red teams and penetration testers specialize in offensive security.

- Defensive security is somewhat the opposite of offensive security, as it is concerned with two main tasks:
  - Preventing intrusions from occurring
  - Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly
Blue teams are part of the defensive security landscape.

### There is much more to defensive security, and the list above only covers a few common topics.
  - Security Operations Center (SOC)
  - Threat Intelligence
  - Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
  - Malware Analysis
  
  ## Security Operations Center (SOC)

A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events. Some of the main areas of interest for a SOC are:

  - Vulnerabilities: Whenever a system vulnerability (weakness) is discovered, it is essential to fix it by installing a proper update or patch. When a fix is not available, the necessary measures should be taken to prevent an attacker from exploiting it. Although remediating vulnerabilities is of vital interest to a SOC, it is not necessarily assigned to them.
  - Policy violations: We can think of a security policy as a set of rules required for the protection of the network and systems. For example, it might be a policy violation if users start uploading confidential company data to an online storage service.
  - Unauthorized activity: Consider the case where a userâ€™s login name and password are stolen, and the attacker uses them to log into the network. A SOC needs to detect such an event and block it as soon as possible before further damage is done.
  - Network intrusions: No matter how good your security is, there is always a chance for an intrusion. An intrusion can occur when a user clicks on a malicious link or when an attacker exploits a public server. Either way, when an intrusion occurs, we must detect it as soon as possible to prevent further damage.

Security operations cover various tasks to ensure protection; one such task is threat intelligence.
