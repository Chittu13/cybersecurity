#### Difference between Defensive security & offensive security

- Breaking into systems might be achieved through exploiting bugs, abusing insecure setups, and taking advantage of unenforced access control policies, among other things. Red teams and penetration testers specialize in offensive security.

- Defensive security is somewhat the opposite of offensive security, as it is concerned with two main tasks:
  - Preventing intrusions from occurring
  - Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly
Blue teams are part of the defensive security landscape.
